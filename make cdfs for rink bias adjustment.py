        """ this method implements the actual location conversion from biased to "unbiased" shot location
        
         the way it works for rink bias adjustment is that for a given shot location in a specific rink,
         you find the cumulative probabilities for that x and y in that rink. Then you calculate the league 
         equivalent x and y that have the same probabilities as the one measured in the specific rink
         
         The equivalency CDFs are calculated using only visiting teams, which ensures that both single rink and
         league wide rinks have as wide a sample of teams as possible but avoid any possible home team bias.
         All of which lets us assume that they are then unbiased enough to be representative (at least enough 
         for standardization purposes)
         
         This is (my adaption of my understanding of) Shuckers' method for rink bias adjustment as described in Appendix A here:
         http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/Total%20Hockey%20Rating%20(THoR)%20A%20comprehensive%20statistical%20rating%20of%20National%20Hockey%20League%20forwards%20and%20defensemen%20based%20upon%20all%20on-ice%20events.pdf
    
         for example, if a shot x coordinate is measured as xmeas in a rink
         
             xprob = this_x_cdf.Prob( xmeas )  # cum prob of seeing xmeas in this rink
             xadj = other_x_cdf.Value( xprob ) # value associated with same prob in rest of league        
    
        analogous process for y
        
        The code for Cdf/Pmf creation and manipulation is taken directly from Allan Downey's code for "Think Bayes"
